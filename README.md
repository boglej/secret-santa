# secret-santa

Created with the function to randomize and assign secret santa givers and receivers.
The benefit is that this automatically and anonymous!

All the program needs is a .csv file with name as the first column and phone number as the second.

The assignation is done using a python dictionary.

The secret santa giver is notified through text. (Not complete yet)
